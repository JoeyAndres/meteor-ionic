# meteor-ionic

### Build [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) apps in [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)!

## Overview

This is an attempt at **real Ionic and Meteor integration**. This is not just Ionic's CSS framework wrapped in a Meteor package. It aims to be a complete port of [Ionicâ€™s Angular directives](http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/) to [Meteor Blaze](https://www.meteor.com/blaze) templates.

## Why?
[Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) is arguably the most comprehensive, polished, cross-platform mobile framework available. But unfortunately a large portion of its functionality comes from Angular directives. [I'm not a fan of trying to force-fit Angular into Meteor](https://medium.com/space-camp/your-meteor-app-probably-doesnt-need-angular-13986a0323f6), so I wanted to see if I could rewrite Ionic specifically for Meteor.
